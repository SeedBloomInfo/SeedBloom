    <h1>SeedBloom Foundation</h1>
    <h3>Nourishment</h3>

    <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
    <p>SeedBloom Foundation nurtures hidden Jewish roots — especially those buried under Soviet silence — like seeds never watered. We help provide warmth, guidance, and nourishment so they can grow, thrive, and proudly blossom.</p>

    <h2>Vision Statement</h2>
    <p>A world where every Jewish soul — no matter how hidden, or seemingly distant — has the opportunity to grow, connect, and flourish. We believe that identity, when nurtured gently and meaningfully, can bloom into pride, purpose, and belonging.</p>

    <p><strong>Hebrew name:</strong> <em>Zera U’Prichah</em></p>

    <h2>Why SeedBloom Was Created</h2>
    <p>For decades, Jewish life in the Soviet Union was buried — not destroyed, but hidden. Generations grew up without the chance to learn, to ask, to believe, to belong.</p>
    <p>But the spark never fully disappeared.</p>
    <p>In one city — far from centers of Jewish life — someone met a young man who had never heard of Shabbat, never seen a mezuzah, never been told he was part of something ancient and beautiful. They spoke. They studied. They lit candles.</p>
    <p>Then another person. And another. Each one was a seed — buried, but alive. Waiting.</p>
    <p>This work began quietly. No big budgets. No global spotlight. Just one-on-one care. A cup of tea. A ride to the hospital. A Jewish book handed gently to someone who never knew they could call themselves Jewish.</p>
    <p>As years passed, the need only grew — not for flashy programs or big buildings, but for people who would walk with others, listen, teach, and help them bloom.</p>
    <p>SeedBloom was created to ensure this kind of care could grow roots, survive, and continue — even if the circumstances changed. It's about people. The ones finding their identity. And the ones helping them do it.</p>

    <h2>Who We Help</h2>
    <p>SeedBloom Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization based in the United States.</p>
    <p>We support the personal, spiritual, and humanitarian care of Jewish individuals — especially in areas where Jewish identity was suppressed or lost, such as Eastern Europe.</p>
    <p>Our work centers on people — helping each soul find its path back to growth through:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gentle relationships</li>
      <li>Jewish education</li>
      <li>Cultural renewal</li>
      <li>Direct personal care</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="taglines">
      <p>“Every soul deserves to bloom!”</p>
      <p>“Nurturing Jewish identity one seed at a time!”</p>
      <p>“From forgotten to flourishing!”</p>
      <p>“Because even buried roots can bloom again!”</p>
